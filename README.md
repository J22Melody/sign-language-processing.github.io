# Sign Language Processing

The goal of this project is to contain and organize the sign language processing literature, datasets, and tasks.

I (AmitMY) intend to use this project as the main source for my thesis background and related work sections.

Once organized, this information could be incorporated in Wikipedia.

This project is hosted in: [https://amitmy.github.io/sign-language-processing/](https://amitmy.github.io/sign-language-processing/)

All contributions are welcomed!
