# Sign Language Processing

The goal of this project is to contain and organize the sign language processing literature, datasets, and tasks.

I (AmitMY) intend to use this project as the main source for my thesis background and related work sections.

This project is hosted in: [sign-language-processing.github.io](https://sign-language-processing.github.io)
